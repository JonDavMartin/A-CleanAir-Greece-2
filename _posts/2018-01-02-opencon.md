#### What is OpenCon

[OpenCon](http://www.opencon2017.org/) is a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information – from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.

Over the years, OpenCon has inspired a number of researchers, librarians, educators and members of civil society to advocate for a more open and transparent access to scientific information. It is an event where individuals involved in projects advancing the state of open science meet to discuss best practice and share experience with others.

#### Why OpenCon Switzerland?

We believe that Switzerland would greatly benefit from a similar forum in the country, and therefore we plan to organise a OpenCon satellite event at the SNSF, in Bern. The goal is to bring together open science practictioners, together with individuals who advocate for openness in other contexts. There was never an OpenCon satellite in Switzerland and we beleive such a meeting will be crucial to catalyse a conversation around open issues at the national level and give the opportunity for the open advocates active in Switzerland to meet and connect with the international community.
