#### What is OpenCon?

> [OpenCon](http://www.opencon2017.org "OpenCon Homepage") is a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyze action toward a more open system for sharing the worldâ€™s information -- from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.

Over the years, OpenCon has inspired a number of researchers, librarians, educators and members of civil society to advocate for a more open and transparent access to scientific information. It is an event where individuals involved in projects advancing the state of open science meet to discuss best practice and share experience with others.

#### Why OpenCon Switzerland?

We believe Switzerland would greatly benefit from a similar forum in the country, and therefore we plan to organise a OpenCon satellite event in Bern. We aim to **bring open science practictioners together with individuals advocating for openness in other contexts**.

We beleive such a forum will catalyse a debate around *open-* topics at the national level and provide the opportunity for active *open-* advocates to meet and connect within Switzerland and with the international community.
